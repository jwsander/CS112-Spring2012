Game Ideas


##1. Meme Madness
A survival beat 'em up/shooter in which the player(s) survive waves of enemies, all of which are based on internet memes.

###Genre
Static screen survival beat'em up. Think Balloon Fight mixed with survival levels from Super Smash Bros, plus bosses.

###Technical Hurdles
   *importing pics
   *illusion of character movement
   *multiple enemy types
   *multiplayer
   *weapons/powerups
   *increasing difficulty levels
   *spawn rates


##2. Socialization
Make and keep social ties with randomly generated personalities so your social network will survive a random disaster (or, at least, you will.)

###Genre
Strategy. Should play kind of like a simplified version of the card game Illuminati [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati_(game)]

###Technical difficulties
   *character traits
   *how character traits interact
   *random generation of characters
   *drawing a web of contacts
   *making disaster effects
   *difficulty levels
   *multiplayer (?)


##3. Killer Skier: Red Snow
Armed with a trusty pair of uzis and pursued by snowboarding ninjas, you ski down a quadruple black diamond with one goal: survive.

###Genre
Run-and-gun shooter, like StarFox or Sin and Punishment (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAljDk3FpqY). Mouse controls crosshair, arrows control skier.

###Technical difficulties
   *multiple enemy types
   *perspective (graphics should go from small to big as you near them)
   *collisions (when one hits a graphic)
   *difficulty levels
   *variable spawn rates (trees, ninjas)
   *death animations
   *jumping
